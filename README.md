I am Technical Officer at [CheckSig](https://checksig.io/), a startup in Milan offering an open solution for bitcoin custody.

My bio: _Digital Gold Institute technical officer.  Cofounder and director of Reposit Limited, providing consulting services in the domain of quantitative finance. QuantLibXL project founder. Formerly 12 years at J.P. Morgan Chase, first in IT management and later as technical lead for front-office pricing spreadsheets._

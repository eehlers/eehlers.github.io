Eric Ehlers

I am Technical Officer at [CheckSig](https://checksig.io/), a startup in Milan offering an open solution for bitcoin custody.

My bio: _Digital Gold Institute technical officer.  Cofounder and director of Reposit Limited, providing consulting services in the domain of quantitative finance. QuantLibXL project founder. Formerly 12 years at J.P. Morgan Chase, first in IT management and later as technical lead for front-office pricing spreadsheets._

CheckSig's solution for bitcoin custody relies on a multivendor solution which includes the Ledger platform, customized for our requirements.  I have written a couple of articles on how to code for the Ledger:

[Programming Ledger #1 - Setup](./ledger.00.setup.md)

[Programming Ledger #2 - Bitcoin Message Signing](./ledger.01.message.md)

[Programming Ledger #3 - ECDSA Signatures](./ledger.02.ecdsa.md)
